# web-viewable point clouds

Some figures in the book are created using [Open3D](https://www.open3d.org)
but their 2D representation is a bit dull and potentially ambiguous.

These figures are saved in [PCD format](https://pointclouds.org/documentation/tutorials/pcd_file_format.html) and can rendered and viewed in a web
browser using [3js](threejs.org).


Hotlinks in the book take you to an online point viewer with the appropriate
glTF file.
