# web-viewable 3D figures

Some figures in the book are created using [PyVista](https://www.pyvista.org)
but their 2D representation is a bit dull and potentially ambiguous.

These figures are rendered as glTF format files and are viewable using a variety
of tools including [Online 3D viewer](3dviewer.net).

Hotlinks in the book take you to the Online 3D viewer and the appropriate
glTF file.
